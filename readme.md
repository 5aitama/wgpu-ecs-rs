# ❤️ LUVE RUST ❤️ #2

It's a personal project that allows me to growth my skills in the [Rust ❤️ language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and how to use the [WebGPU API](https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/) with the crate [wgpu-rs](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs) because I ❤️ talking with my horny GPU 🤤. This project also allows me to learn how to create an [ECS architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) from scratch in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and growth my knowledge on it.

## 🛠️ Prerequisite

* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) installed of course.
* Because I use [shaderc crate](https://crates.io/crates/shaderc) you will need to have [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) and [CMake 3](https://cmake.org/) installed on your computer.

> I don't know if you need to have [Vulkan](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/) already installed on your computer to run the project. Tell me if its the case or free feel to you to create a pull request 😉.
